# Pet_Shop
This is a project that my professor from college requested us to make,
he said we needed to create a system and the code had to have at least all four pillars of object-oriented programming and the architecture MVC, so here's what I handed in.

## How to start
The project need you do somethings to run correctly: 
- Your MySQL need be running on port 3306 and the password is 1234, if you would like to change it, just go to class **DataBase** on package **Connection**
- On your MySQL run the follwing code `CREATE DATABASE petshop`
OK, the project must run correctly if you follow the structions correctly

## A bit spoiler
Well, as the project's name said, this is a system of a pet shop, the deadline was short so i only had time to make the management part.

The language that i had to use was Java, i tried to make a simple ORM using the models classes like Laravel do on it's models classes.
It was a challenge because i work with Laravel, while Java i just use on college.
I learned C# doing a course on Udemy and seeing the similarity between Java and C# was very interesting.
Of course there is differences between than, i thing the main difference was the lack of properties in attributes, despite having auto code creation i thing it's a charm using properties while declare an attribute in C#

Well, that's it. I will be glad if you use and leave an comment saying what you liked and what i need to improve.

Thanks for your time, bye :smile::v:
